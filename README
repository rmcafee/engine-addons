EngineAddons
============
I wanted to give the new Rails Engines support for database migrations but I wanted to keep the migrations separate from my core application. There are situations where it works better if I can actually migrate just an engine/plugin separate from my application or other engine plugins.

Example
=======
# So let's say you got an engine/plugin and you put it in your plugin directory. It's called 'super_forum'
# now you can just move your db folder into your plugin just like 'apps' and 'config' and run:

rake engine_addons:migrate ENGINE='super_forum'

# If you want to actually migrate down or to a certain version you can actually run:
rake engine_addons:migrate ENGINE='super_forum' VERSION=0

# You can also just migrate all of your engine apps 
rake engine_addons:migrate_all

# Each addon/plugin should keep it's own schema_migrations_info now.
